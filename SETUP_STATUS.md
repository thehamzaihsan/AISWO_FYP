- ✅ All dependencies installed (root, backend, frontend)
- ✅ `.env` file created in backend
- ✅ Project structure verified

## ⚠️ What You Need to Do

### 1. Firebase Configuration (REQUIRED)
The app won't run without Firebase. You need:
- `serviceAccountKey.json` in `aiswo-backend/` directory
- Get it from: Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service Accounts → Generate new private key

### 2. API Keys (OPTIONAL but recommended)
Edit `aiswo-backend/.env` and add:
- OpenWeather API key (for weather alerts)
- Gemini AI API key (for chatbot)

## 🏃 Run the App

```bash
# From the root directory
npm start
```

This starts both backend (port 5000) and frontend (port 3000).
